The most difficult part of agreeing to follow best practices and standards is getting into situations where you just want to get things done and standards aren't a concern anymore.

I'm sure best of us have been in situations where we needed to solve a problem instantly in a magical way; that's when we removed the "Ideal developer" mask and went full [ninja mode](https://javascript.info/ninja-code).

Another example is while working in a team and everyone just wants the task completed (like if they're not the one to modify it the next day).  What we can do is implement certain rules in our project to ensure that we do not simply ignore the standards.

This is a guide on how to setup **Husky and Commitlint** to enforce the commit message practices. A continuation of my last blog [Git Good: Best Practices for Branch Naming and Commit Messages](/on/git-practices).
<br />

## Husky Setup

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is a modern way of implementing [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks). Or like the readme says: 

> Modern native Git hooks made easy. Husky improves your commits and more 🐶 *woof!* 

Husky is extremely lightweight and fast!  Linting commit messages (enforcing message format) is merely one of its many uses. Husky can be used to *"Automatically lint your commit messages, code, and run tests upon committing or pushing"*.

Install and Initialize Husky using following commands, for other package managers [check here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/get-started.html#install).

```sh title="shell"
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky init
```

The `hysky init` command will create a file with a default script:  
 
 ```text title=".husky/pre-commit"
 npm test
 ```
 
You can safely remove it because we will overwrite it later.
 <br />

## Install and Configure Commitlint

Commitlint is a tool that exists just to ensure that you write your commit messages properly. Install @commitlint/cli and [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) as dev dependencies.

```sh title="shell"
npm install -D @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional  
```

> We use @commitlint/config-conventional as our base configuration because we developed our best practices with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) as the foundation.

### Configuration

I created a configuration that applied all of the commit message standards outlined in the last blog post.  You can add, update, or remove any ruleset; the **@commitlint/config-conventional** is enough for normal usecase.

```mjs showLineNumbers {2} title="commitlint.config.mjs"
const config = {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  rules: {
    // 1. Format: <type>([optional scope]): <description> - enforced by most rules below.
    // Enforce that the type is not empty.
    'type-empty': [2, 'never'],
    
    // Enforce specific commit types. Add/remove types based on the project.
    'type-enum': [
      2, 
      'always', 
      ['feat', 'fix', 'build', 'chore', 'ci', 'style', 'refactor']
    ],
    
    // Subject/Description Rules:
    // 2. Short and Summarized: Try to fit the subject line inside 50 characters.
    'header-max-length': [2, 'always', 50],
    
    // 3. Capitalize the description: Start subject line with a capital letter.
    // 'sentence-case' capitalizes the first letter of the subject. Mostly useful for generating changelogs.
    'subject-case': [2, 'always', 'sentence-case'],
    
    // 4. Avoid trailing period.
    'subject-full-stop': [2, 'never', '.'],
    
    // Body Rules:
    // 5. Body is added by leaving a blank line after the subject line.
    'body-leading-blank': [2, 'always'],
    
    // 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
    'body-max-line-length': [2, 'always', 72],

    // Footer Rules:    
    // Ensure a blank line precedes the footer.
    'footer-leading-blank': [2, 'always'],
    
    // Rule for Optional Scope:
    // Enforce that if a scope is used, it is in lower-case.
    'scope-case': [2, 'always', 'lower-case'],
  } 
};

export default config;
 ```  
 
 Place this config file in your project root.
 
 > It is important that you extend Commitlint with any of your preferred configuration libraries (as seen in line 2 above) in order to perform linting.  As previously mentioned, other options are entirely optional. Refer [this](https://commitlint.js.org/reference/configuration.html) for advanced configuration.
 
 ### Add Hook
 
 Add the following content to the `commit-msg` hook file in the husky folder.
 
 ```sh title=".husky/commit-msg"
 npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1  
 ```
 
 That's it. Now the commitlint will **lint** your commit messages based on the added config.
 
 ### Test Commitlint
 
To test your Commitlint configuration, make a `git commit`.

```sh title="shell"
git add --all
git commit -m "chore: Add linting on commit message"
```

If the commit format does not follow the configured rules, an error will be thrown, preventing the commit action.<br />
For example:

```sh title="shell"
❯ git commit -m "foo: this will fail"
⧗   input: foo: this will fail
✖   subject must be sentence-case [subject-case]
✖   type must be one of [feat, fix, build, chore, ci, style, refactor] [type-enum]

✖   found 2 problems, 0 warnings
ⓘ   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint

husky - commit-msg script failed (code 1)  
```

All that being said, most of the personal projects we work on do not require such strict standards. Still, I keep this configuration in all new projects to get used to it and build it into a habit.
